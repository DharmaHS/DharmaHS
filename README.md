My name is Dharma Siemarga

This is my github page that I use to keep most of my portfolio project because we don't have a good way of determining people's worth.

and thus, this is what you're here for:

## About me
I learn stuff fast, do stuff efficiently, work well with other people in project scenario in managing workflow and just being a cog in the machine (I do both).

I read, write and speak English, Chinese and Japanese


## Education background
I was a self-tuaght at basically everything from programming and adobe software suite until I had the mis-fortune of being enrolled in Tsinghua University（清华大学）, one of the most brutal, back-breaking educational institution that is the equivalent of MIT of China, I went through their software engineering program undergraduate that basically equates to "you now 'officially' know software engineering" despite the idiotic nature of tertiary education in this day and age, in which I learn basically nothing outside of what I already know through online resources.


**TL;DR, I'm a self-learner that has the standard quality control stamp of the top 10 university in the world.**
